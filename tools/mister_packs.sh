# Manage the PC-9821 firmware pack FILES already on the MiSTer SD card.
#
# ONE JOB: on-card pack inventory and switching. It never builds a pack, never verifies one
# against your dumps and never uploads one from a dump set -- tools/mister_load.sh does all
# of that, and it is the tool to use to PUT a new pack on the card. This one rearranges and
# prunes what is already there. tools/deploy_mister.sh stages the same files offline.
#
# THE MGLs ARE THE SOURCE OF TRUTH for which pack is active, and there is no single active
# pack: each MGL names the pack it loads, resolved relative to games/<setname>/ (the setname
# is PC9821, so games/PC9821/). A card carrying both firmware sets carries two MGLs naming
# two different packs. So this script reads the MGLs off the card and treats every pack one
# of them names as PROTECTED: prune will not delete one, and list says which MGL needs what.
#
# The pack is a *runtime input*: it holds whichever ITF + BIOS + font the user is entitled
# to use, and the core never ships any of it. Alternates live in games/PC9821/packs/ so the
# card does not accumulate loose builds, and switching between them needs no FPGA rebuild.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/mister_packs.sh list                     # what each MGL loads, what is stashed, what is stale
#   tools/mister_packs.sh use <pack.bin> [mgl]    # install packs/<pack.bin> as that MGL's pack
#   tools/mister_packs.sh stash <file> [name]     # upload a local pack into packs/
#   tools/mister_packs.sh prune                   # delete packs no MGL names and nothing has stashed
#
# `use` takes a name UNDER packs/ (run `list` to see them), because that is what it copies
# onto the pack the MGL names; it does not rewrite the MGL.
#
# env: MISTER_HOST (ssh destination, default root@MiSTer; a bare host name gets root@),
