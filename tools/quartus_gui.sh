#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tools/quartus_gui.sh - open the Quartus GUI for this project, inside the raetro/quartus
# container, with the host's X11 session forwarded into it.
#
# The build tooling (tools/build.py) runs Quartus HEADLESS as `quartus_sh --flow compile`
# against a copied scratch tree so a killed launcher can never dirty the source. This script
# is the interactive counterpart and is intentionally the opposite: it runs the REAL Quartus
# GUI (not quartz_sh) directly against the SOURCE tree, because a human opening the GUI wants
# to read and edit the checked-out project, not a throwaway copy.
#
# Display transport is X11 ONLY, on purpose. The raetro/quartus image ships no Qt platform
# plugin at all (no libqxcb.so, no libqwayland*.so, no platforms/ directory) and the `quartus`
# binary is a legacy X11 client, not a Qt-QPA app -- so `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland` cannot work
# and X11 is reached through XWayland on a Wayland session. The display scaling you have set
# in KDE (usually 1.25x/1.5x/2x) is therefore NOT picked up automatically: an X11 app under
# fractional Wayland scaling renders at 96 DPI and looks small/blurry. This script compensates
# by planting an X resource database (Xft.dpi) in the container so the GUI draws at the same
# size as the rest of the desktop.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/quartus_gui.sh                 # open the project in the Quartus GUI
#   tools/quartus_gui.sh --shell         # drop into a bash shell in the container instead
#   tools/quartus_gui.sh --project foo   # open a different revision (default z486_mister)
#   tools/quartus_gui.sh -- <arbitrary quartus args>
#
# Environment: QUARTUS_IMAGE, CONTAINER_RUNTIME (the same names the build uses).
#
# Caveats, stated rather than hidden:
#   * This runs Quartus against the live source tree, so a GUI compile writes its project
#     DB and can re-generate build outputs right in the checkout. That is the point of this
#     script, but it means you must not leave a headless build running against the same
#     tree (Quartus locks the project DB), and you should check the diff before committing.
#   * The first launch of the GUI unpacks Quartus' own cache under $HOME in the container
#     (set to /tmp here, so it vanishes with the container); that first open is several
#     seconds slower than later ones.
