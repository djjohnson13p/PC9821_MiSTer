"""Prove a firmware pack is self-consistent, and, when you have them, that it IS the dumps.

The pack is assembled by tools/build_pack.py and is then consumed twice from two
artifacts: the card loads `pc98pack.bin` and the benches load `pc98pack.mem`. Neither
consumer can tell a pack built from other inputs, built without the banks, or edited after
the fact -- the guest simply runs different firmware and the symptom looks like a core bug.
That is the failure this check exists to make impossible.

TWO MODES, and the difference is what a user has to hand:

  tools/check_pack.py --pack PACK [--mem MEM]
      The pack ALONE, checked against the firmware's own contracts. This is the mode for
      a pack sitting on a card, where the dumps are not shipped with it. It asserts:

        * the pack is exactly 1 MiB and its regions do not overlap or run past the end;
        * the ITF slot's reset vector is a far jump into F800:0000-7FFF, and the main
          BIOS's top half carries its entry vector -- the two bytes the machine needs
          before it can execute anything;
        * every 32 KiB bank slot, and the 0xE8000 64 KiB lower shadow, has a zero 8-bit
          sum IN EACH BYTE POSITION. The ITF's own ROM-sum test (BANK4@0x194-0x1C4) sums a
          window word-wise into two independent accumulators, `add dl,al` for the
          even-addressed byte and `add dh,ah` for the odd, and requires both zero. A
          window that sums to zero only in combination still fails on the machine;
        * the ANK window at +0x30000 equals the same bytes of the font at +0x80000. The
          pack carries FONT.ROM verbatim AND a slice of it, so the two must agree -- a
          pack built from two different fonts is caught here with no dumps at all;
        * no layout region is 0xFF filler, which is what a missing input leaves;
        * the `.mem` mirror, when given, describes exactly the layout regions and every
          word equals the corresponding pack word -- a stale `.mem` beside a fresh `.bin`
          would otherwise be loaded silently by the benches.

  tools/check_pack.py --pack PACK --dumps DIR      (or the explicit --itf/--bios/... form)
      The same checks PLUS the identity checks: every layout region compared byte for
      byte against the dump it is defined to hold -- the ITF slot against BANK4.BIN, both
      halves of the main BIOS, the ANK window against FONT.ROM[0x800:0x1800], the
      extended banks, the IDE slot (all 32 KiB of bank 3, not just the 8 KiB the D8000
      window shows), the 0xF8000 window against BANK7.BIN, and the whole 0x46800-byte
      FONT.ROM verbatim at +0x80000. This is the mode for the machine the pack is built on.

ONE MACHINE, ONE DIRECTORY: `--dumps DIR` supplies all five inputs at once, exactly as
build_pack.py --dumps does, and looks for the rhythm image and the PC-9801-86's
SOUND.ROM in that directory too.

Exit status is 0 only when every check selected holds; otherwise each failing region and
the first differing offsets are printed and the exit status is 1.
