// same as jt10_adpcm_acc, except no linear interpolation

// Adds all 6 channels
// sampling frequency to 55.5 kHz
//
// LOCAL CHANGE (this repository): two, both about the drum-bus clip.
//
// 1. `gain_shift` attenuates EACH drum before it enters the summing accumulator, not
// the summed result. An attenuation applied to the OUTPUT (as jt12_top used to, at
// `adpcmA_l >>> rhythm_gain_shift`) would only scale an already flat-topped sum,
// which is the owner's "lowering the rhythm volume does not fix the distortion".
// At gain_shift == 0 the shift is bit-identical to upstream.
//
// 2. `acc` is a 16-BIT WRAPPING accumulator, which is the die's own six-drum sum
// (YM2608-LLE fmopna_impl.c:5363-5383, `ac_rss_accm1[0] = accm1 & 0xffff`), and
// `pcm_out` is that wrapped bus SIGN-EXTENDED to the 20-bit port. It is neither
// upstream's 16-bit `sat16` (a flat top - the "drums clipping" the owner heard)
// nor a wide no-limit sum: the die wraps, so three or more near-peak drums
// sign-flip the bus (e.g. +46080 -> -19456), and the FM+ADPCM junction above
// clamps ONCE (jt08_acc.v; the die's output-shifter rails == ymfm's clamp16).
// This module must not pre-clamp (YM2608-LLE fmopna_impl.c, the die model).
//
// The shift is done on the 16-bit pcm_in and the (whole) result is then sign-extended,
// rather than shifting an 18-bit sign-extended copy. The two are the same arithmetic,
// but the 18-bit-variable-shift form is miscompiled where it is bound into the
// accumulator (Verilator 5.052 emits a value near the 18-bit rail for any non-zero
// shift, which makes the SUM louder as the volume is lowered); see the r13/257 report.
// Keep the shift on the narrow signed signal.
