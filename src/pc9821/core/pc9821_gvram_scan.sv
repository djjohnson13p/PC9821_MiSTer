// PC-9821 GVRAM scanout line fetch and ping-pong line buffer.
//
// The scanout is a SIBLING of the CPU datapath and the engines rather than a child:
// this module only reads port B of pc9821_gvram_mem, and nothing in it can reach the
// CPU's port A or either engine.
//
// There is no vertical counter here and none is needed for the 200-line display mode: the
// line ORIGIN arrives as `scan_line_base`, which pc9821_system takes from the GDC2
// display-address decode (pc9821_gdc2's gfx_line_addr). That decode halves its line index
// in the 200-line mode, so two consecutive raster lines present the SAME base: the same GDC
// line on two raster lines. The doubling lives there, not here; the tick is still one per
// raster line. The 200-line mode's graphics/text INTERLEAVE lives HERE on the fetch side:
// `gfx_odd_line` skips the odd display line of each pair ENTIRELY - NP2kai fetches a display
// line only `if ((!(mg.liney & 1)) || (!(gdc.mode1 & 0x10)))` (vram/makegrph.c:155) - and
// that line shows text over black (vram/sdraw.mcr:199-243 p_2i), which
// pc9821_video_mixer's own `gfx_odd_line` gate draws. `line_ready` does not dip on a
// skipped line: the buffer still holds a complete (stale) line and the mixer's gate is
// what hides it.
//
// The fetch reads the M10K array DIRECTLY on port B: ONE column per clk_sys, 80 clk_sys per line
// of the 2014-clk_sys budget. There is no SDRAM burst to pace and no write-combining buffer to
// flush behind, so stripe (the fetch reading SDRAM behind a pending write-back) cannot arise.
