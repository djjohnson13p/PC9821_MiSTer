// ==== WHAT THIS PROVES ====
// The rhythm ROM's pack-loader path: a synthetic pack stream written through pc9821_rhythm_loader fills RHYTHM_ROM at pack offset 0x49000 with the exact bytes the stream carried (byte order and offsets included), a stream whose region is zero leaves the ROM reading zero (which is NOT silence -- the decoder ramps zero codes; this bench only pins the LOADER, not the audio), and a download under another ioctl index writes nothing. With +RHYTHM_REGION=<file> it additionally drives the region from the 4096 words build_pack.py wrote there in a real pack, so the loader is proved against the tooling's own output and not only a fixture. It does NOT use or assert any percussion sample data, and it does not claim the channel is audible without a user-supplied image.

// The DUT is the loader plus the ROM it fills. RHYTHM_ROM is the same module
// jtopna instantiates (pc9821_dpram-backed, 12-bit words, byte read), so the
// byte the chip would read is the byte this bench reads through the ROM's own
// read port. pc9821_system wires the loader's outputs into pc9821_opna ->
// jtopna -> RHYTHM_ROM; that wiring is a straight pass-through and is not
// re-derived here, because the ROM's contents are only observable through the
// read port the bench already owns.
//
// No sample data appears anywhere in this file. The synthetic pattern is a
// function of the pack address, chosen so a byte-order swap or an offset error
// changes the comparison; it is not a drum kit and is not committed as audio.
