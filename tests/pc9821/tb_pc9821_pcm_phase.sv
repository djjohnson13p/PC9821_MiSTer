// ==== WHAT THIS PROVES ====
// The 86-PCM's 0xA466 phase bit free-runs at the selected sample rate and keeps toggling while playback is DISABLED, because a driver calibrates the card by watching that bit before it ever starts playback and would hang on a frozen one.
//
// ---- the bench's own account of where the expectation comes from ----
//
// THE CONTRACT, and why it is not the implementation written down. The bit is a
// divide of the card's sample clock, so what a guest can observe is its RATE. The
// thing that can silently be wrong is whether it runs when playback is off, and
// that is not a detail: the card's own driver measures this bit to work out the
// sample clock before it programs anything.
//
//   [source, from-NP2kai] cbus/pcm86io.c:286, pcm86_ia466:
//
//       ret = ((past << 1) >= stepclock) ? 1 : 0;
//
//   `past` is the time since the last sample, and it is advanced from the CPU
//   clock with NO reference to whether playback is enabled -- the `fifo & 0x80`
//   test a few lines above guards only RECALC_NOWCLKWAIT, a host-side timing
//   recalculation, not the phase computation. So on the reference the bit keeps
//   toggling with the buffer stopped.
//
//   [source, the RTL's own header, src/pcm86/pc9821_pcm86.sv] The block states the
//   same thing and names the alternative: "The accumulator free-runs whether or
//   not playback is enabled, because that calibration happens BEFORE playback
//   starts; qemu's does not, and a driver waiting for transitions on a frozen bit
//   is the hang qemu's own comment warns about."
//
// That is what makes this worth a test rather than a comment. TWO REFERENCES
// DISAGREE: NP2kai free-runs, qemu gates the accumulator. A future change that
// "simplifies" the block toward qemu's shape is a plausible mistake, it would look
// like a tidy-up, and nothing in this tree would catch it -- the existing pcm86
// bench explicitly masks bit 0 ("the free-running sample phase, so it is masked")
// because its expectations are about the full/empty bits beside it.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, and it is one behaviour seen two ways: the bit toggles while
// playback is disabled (a frozen bit fails, bounded, rather than hanging), and the
// period between its rising edges is one sample period at the selected rate. The
// second half is what makes the first half meaningful: a bit that toggled at the
// wrong rate would be just as useless to a driver calibrating against it.
//
// The rates are the reset rate (index 0, 44100 Hz, no 0xA468 write at all) and
// index 4 (11025 Hz). Both are checked with 0xA468 bit 7 CLEAR throughout, which is
// the state a driver calibrates in and the state the existing bench never visits.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated so it is not assumed: this is from-a-reference
// only. No register of this card has ever been measured on the real machine,
// so if the machine turns out to
// freeze the bit, this bench is asserting the reference's behaviour and not the
// machine's, and the difference would be found by that probe and not here.
