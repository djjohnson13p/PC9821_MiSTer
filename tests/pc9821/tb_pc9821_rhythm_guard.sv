// ==== WHAT THIS PROVES ====
// TB_PC9821_RHYTHM_GUARD:
// The rhythm loader's region bounds, which is where its own arithmetic can alias: waddr is offset[12:1], so a write one word past the region's end computes a word index that truncates to 0 -- it would overwrite ROM word 0, the first byte of the first percussion sample, on every pack download, using data from a region the loader does not own. The pack download walks the whole 1 MiB pack during the same stream, so the addresses on both sides of the region really do pass this module. The bench drives writes below the region, at its first and last words, one word past its end, and far past it, and requires that only the in-region words land; the source of the layout is tools/build_pack.py's RHYTHM_OFFSET/RHYTHM_SIZE and its region tuple, which places the slot at 0x49000, 8192 bytes, between the extended banks ending at 0x49000 and the option-ROM slot at 0x70000.

// The DUT is the loader plus the ROM it fills, the same pair
// tb_pc9821_rhythm_rom drives: RHYTHM_ROM is the module jtopna instantiates
// (pc9821_dpram-backed, 12-bit words, byte read), so the byte the chip would
// read is the byte this bench reads through the ROM's own read port.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE BENCH FROM tb_pc9821_rhythm_rom, which already covers
// the loader: that bench pins the INDEX guard (a stream under another ioctl
// index writes nothing) and the in-region contents byte for byte. It does not
// drive a single address OUTSIDE the region with the matching index, so the two
// ADDRESS guards -- ioctl_addr >= RHYTHM_PACK_OFFSET and offset < RHYTHM_BYTES
// -- are exercised by nothing. They are the guards that keep the loader out of
// ROM word 0, and the upper one is not redundant: offset[12:1] on offset 8192
// truncates to 0, which is a real alias rather than a discarded write.
//
// WHICH GUARD IS LOAD-BEARING, measured by removing each in turn:
//
//   * the UPPER bound (offset < RHYTHM_BYTES) is load-bearing. With it removed,
//     a write one word past the region lands on ROM word 0 and check 2 fails
//     naming the alias: "OVERWROTE ROM word 0 -- the alias, and offset[12:1]
//     truncating to 0 is its mechanism".
//   * the LOWER bound (ioctl_addr >= RHYTHM_PACK_OFFSET) is REDUNDANT. With it
//     removed every check still passes, because offset is a 27-bit subtraction
//     and an address below the region underflows to a value far above
//     RHYTHM_BYTES. It is kept as a defensive test, not because the width of
//     the subtraction is trusted to stay wide.
//
// Check 3 therefore pins the OUTCOME -- a write below the region must not land
// -- rather than the mechanism that currently achieves it, which is the right
// thing for a specification test to pin.
//
// No sample data appears anywhere in this file. The values streamed are the
// address's own low bits, so a wrong word index or a swapped byte pair changes
// the comparison; they are not a drum kit and are not committed as audio.
